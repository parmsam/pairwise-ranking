# pairwise-ranking

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pairwise-ranking is to provide a pairwise ranking app in
Shiny using [dynamic UI
capabilties](https://mastering-shiny.org/action-dynamic.html). This repo
was also an exploration on how quickly I can create a working version
using some help from ChatGPT.

## Run the app

In RStudio IDE:

``` r
shiny::runGitHub("pairwise-ranking", "parmsam", "master")
```
